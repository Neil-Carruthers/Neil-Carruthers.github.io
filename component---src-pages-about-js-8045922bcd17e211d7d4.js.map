Thanks for taking the time to check out my site. At this point you probably already know that I'm a big fan of React and as web3 infrastructure. Let me tell you a little bit about how I got started.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            I first began my journey back in 2000. I had a lot of fun messing around with HTML and CSS to create web pages about my favorite shows and video games. Quickly I started to become more interested in how to write computer programs. I started out writing some very simple programs in C that could do my high school math homework for me (it even printed out the individual steps that it took).\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Upon graduating from high school I enrolled in the <span><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.dal.ca/faculty/computerscience/undergraduate-programs/study-computer-science.html\">Bachelor of Computer Science program at Dalhousie University</a></span>. I greatly enjoyed my time learning about IT fundamentals, software development, data structures, algorithms and database applications. I ultimately focused on web design and development and learned a great deal about the inner workings of web browsers and the abilities of JavaScript. However at that time JavaScript was being used mainly to add small amounts of interactivity to websites, AJAX programming was very new and Node.js had yet to be released.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            With the limited scope of what I could do within web and mobile development at the time, I began to grow more interested in drafting and engineering design. I enrolled in the <span><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.nscc.ca/programs-and-courses/programs/plandescr.aspx?prg=CDTN&pln=CADTCNMECH\">Mechanical Design and Drafting program at the Lunenburg campus of the Nova Scotia Community College</a></span> and began to learn the basics of engineering design and how to express those designs using computer aided drafting software.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Upon completing the program I worked as a <span><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://lpcorp.com/\">mechanical drafter at a large scale manufacturing facility</a></span> before moving on to a role as a <span><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://cahill.ca/what-we-do-best/integrated-construction/atlantica/\">mechanical designer at Eastern Canada's largest commercial HVAC and plumbing contractor</a></span>. Finally I joined a small <span><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ableinc.ca/en/\">civil and structural engineering firm where I created designs according to the latest environmental standards</a></span> before I transitioned to becoming a full time software developer.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Fast forward to today. I am currently a <span><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.binogi.com/\">software developer at an international educational technology start-up</a></span> with experience in modern JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, GraphQL, RESTful APIs, web3 and clean architectural style, bringing my experiences from engineering design into software development.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            I believe that React has really proven to be a remarkable tool for creating front end client applications as a result of its amazing efficiency and its developer experience, among many other things. When I first learned about web3 I was impressed by the new ways of thinking about how to execute back-end logic and store data and I'm very excited to see how these new technologies will grow and fill more roles in the years to come.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div className={styles.colRight}>\n          <StaticImage\n              src=\"../images/me.png\"\n              alt=\"personal\"\n              layout=\"fixed\"\n              className={styles.profileImage}\n              width={300}\n              height={300}\n          />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </main>\n  )\n}\n\nexport const Head = () => <Seo />","// extracted by mini-css-extract-plugin\nexport var colLeft = \"about-module--colLeft--ba067\";\nexport var colRight = \"about-module--colRight--005e5\";\nexport var container = \"about-module--container--517ce\";\nexport var profileImage = \"about-module--profileImage--1087a\";\nexport var row = \"about-module--row--d25e7\";"],"names":["description","children","site","useStaticQuery","metaDescription","siteMetadata","defaultTitle","title","name","content","property","author","About","className","target","rel","href","S","src","alt","layout","width","height","Head"],"sourceRoot":""}
