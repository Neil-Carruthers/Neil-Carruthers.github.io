As I've worked with other developers over the years, I've often noticed that it's a common tendency for people to try to figure things out as they go along. Instead of taking the time to think about everything upfront, they jump right in and just start coding. I'm not a fan of this strategy because I believe that it can easily lead to wasted resources when people unexpectedly build something the wrong way.

Through my prior experiences as a mechanical designer I've learned a lot about how to design a product on paper before anyone attempts to build it. I believe that this experience is valuable in the software development industry, as many common mistakes can be avoided by planning everything out ahead of time using best practices and effective problem solving methods. It provides an opportunity to think about how everything should work, what resources are needed and the types of issues that may arise.

Another valuable part of my experience as an engineering designer was learning how to design things based on best practices, job specifications and established industry standards. It creates a framework which puts the designer in the best possible position to succeed while avoiding reinventing the wheel.
